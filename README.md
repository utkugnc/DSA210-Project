# DSA210-Project Proposal
DSA 210 Project - World Development Indicators and World Happiness Report

## MOTIVATION
In the World Happiness Report, we can observe each country's "happiness" index from 2005 to 2024. Although these scores are calculated based on certain stated parameters, the report does not make it clear how much each parameter contributes, or whether there may be other factors outside the reported parameters that also influence happiness. Moreover, some parameters may only affect happiness in the existence of others. The aim of this project is not only to study the impact of the reported parameters, but also to analyze the effect of the variables in the World Development Indicators dataset and to quantify their influence.

## DATA SET
The data is gathered from two sources 
* https://www.worldhappiness.report/data-sharing/
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicolasgonzalezmunoz/world-bank-world-development-indicators

## Main Questions
There are two main questions I aim to investigate:

* To what extent does each parameter affect happiness?
* How does the effect of a given parameter, or a combination of parameters, on happiness change in the presence of other parameters?

## Method
Using the data science methods, data visualization techniques, and statistical knowledge covered in the course DSA210, I will address these main questions, as well as additional questions that may arise during the analysis.
